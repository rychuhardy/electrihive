# ElectriHive

ElectriHive is a academic project for Operations Research classes. It's purpose is finding optimal electrical grid for a given graph representing an unelectrified area.
ElectriHive uses a Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to find cheapest way to electrify the area represented by a weighted graph. As cost function, it uses a sum of the prices of all power plants and the costs of transporting the energy to the vertices - the weights of the edges which represent possible routes between places.
